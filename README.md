UNILOADER is an initial-stage malware loader that detects your scripting environment and drops cross-platform payloads. It’s like a Swiss Army knife… if the Swiss Army knife was obsessed with mail bombs.  
> "Because nothing says 'secure code' like a guy hiding in a cabin in the woods."

It uses obfuscation techniques to stay stealthy and evade basic detection. Think of it as the cyber equivalent of wearing a hood, sunglasses, and a fake beard at the post office.  
> "Ted K would’ve loved Python… if it shipped with duct tape."

The loader supports Windows, Linux, and macOS targets, choosing the right payload dynamically based on detected runtime. Yes, it’s multiplatform, but sadly it cannot deliver you cookies in the mail.  
> "He only ever delivered manifests. And terror."

Installation is trivial: drop the script in the target environment and let UNILOADER handle the rest. It’s like a postal worker who actually enjoys their route… except slightly more explosive.  
> "Mail service 2.0: now with optional chaos."

Logging and reporting are minimal to reduce fingerprints. UNILOADER only tells you what it needs to know — kind of like Ted K’s journals, except with fewer FBI interviews.  
> "He kept a diary; UNILOADER keeps logs. Whoops, similar vibes."

> ⚠️ Note: UNILOADER requires a **file delivery C2**, ideally **not the attacker’s Cobalt Strike bidirectional listener**. It can be hosted on **free platforms or IPFS** for convenience and deniability.  
> "Ted K probably would’ve preferred carrier pigeons… or maybe a dead drop under a rock."

> "Remember: the mailman may come twice, but UNILOADER only knocks once."
